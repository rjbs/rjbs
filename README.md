# 👋🏽 Hello, world!

I like to write code.  I've written a fair bit of it.  Some of it has been
useful and some of it has been stupid, and some of it was both at once.

Lots of my code is written in Perl.  I spent a bunch of time working on free
software written in Perl, including several years as project manager for Perl
itself.  I like a lot of other languages, too, though.  Still, I'm fastest in
Perl.

I've been sort of an email wonk for a long time, and now I work at Fastmail.  I
write some code, but mostly I try to make sure everybody else writing code can
get things done effectively and harmoniously.

I also like playing with APIs for fun.
